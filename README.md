# Frontend Nanodegree Website Optimization Project

### This project has three components:

1. Optomizing Page Speed of index.html using the tools taught in the course. You can evaluate the speed using Google PageSpeed Insights.
2. Optomizing the Frames per Second (fps) in pizza.html when the user scrolls down the page and the pizzas move. The fps need to be 60 or higher.
How this was done: Took calulation of phase outside of for loop and placed the consistant 5 numbers to reference in an array and optimized by use of element lookup. 
3. Optomize the time it takes to resize the pizzas. The target is under 5ms.
How this was done: Took calculation of dx and newWidth out of for loop and optimized by use of element lookup.
